### Michael Cohen, Philosophy Department, Tilburg University

This page contains a collection of Python Notebooks that are useful as teaching aids in philosophy classes. To use them, only a very minimal programming knowledge is required. 

At the moment, most of the notebooks listed below demonstrate topics and concepts that are often covered in an introductory class to critical/Scientific/Bayesian thinking (e.g. simulating a base rate fallacy situation, the possibility of a replication crisis in published research via a toy model, si some probability puzzles.)

I list the different notebooks according to topic.
