# philosophy teaching resources
### Michael Cohen, Philosophy Department, Tilburg University

This page contains a collection of Python Notebooks that are useful as teaching aids in philosophy classes. To use them, only a very minimal programming knowledge is required. 

At the moment, most of the notebooks listed below demonstrate topics and concepts that are often covered in an introductory class to critical/Scientific/Bayesian thinking (e.g. simulating a base rate fallacy situation, the possibility of a replication crisis in published research via a toy model, some probability puzzles.)

This is all WIP with typos and mistakes; any comments, suggestions, and additions are welcomed. 

I list the different notebooks according to topic. 

### **Critical and Scientific Thinking notebooks** 
(Many of these notebooks follow the material from the book *Odds & Ends
Introducing Probability & Decision with a Visual Emphasis* by
Jonathan Weisberg, [available  here](https://jonathanweisberg.org/vip/), which I highly recommend)

* [Simulation of the Base rate fallacy (Odds and Ends, Chapter 10)](base_rate_fallacy_(Odds_and_Ends,_page_71).ipynb)
* [Simulating the rule of Succession](The_rule_of_succession_simulation.ipynb)
* [Probability puzzle: a simple dice game](dice_game_simulation.ipynb) 
* [Probability puzzle: Laplace's urn](Simulation_of_Laplace's_urn_puzzle_.ipynb)
* [A simple toy model for the replication crisis in published research](https://github.com/michaelcohen-dev/philosophy_teaching_resources/blob/main/replication%20crisis%20for%20a%20simple%20scientific%20method.ipynb)
* [Mystery coins and inductive problems (Odds and Ends Appendix D)](https://github.com/michaelcohen-dev/philosophy_teaching_resources/blob/main/induction%20and%20probability.ipynb)
* [Simulating the St. Petersburg Paradox](st_petersburg_paradox.ipyn)
* [Condorcet's jury theorem](Condorcet_jury_theorem_simple_simulation.ipynb)

### **Philosophy of AI Notebooks**

* [Bias in the BERT large language model](
Large_Language_Models_and_bias.ipynb)
