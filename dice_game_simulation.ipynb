        "* We have two fair dice.\n",
        "* I throw one dice, you donâ€™t see what I got.\n",
        "* To win, you need to get a higher number with the second dice.\n",

        "*Maybe* you have the intuitive response that this game is fair and therefore the answer should be 0.5. The correct answer is in fact $\\frac{5}{12}$. It's more likely that you will lose. There are many ways to get to this answer, but I suggest getting $P(win)$ by using the law of total probability, where the exclusive and exhaustive set of events we condition on is the possible results of the first dice. But this is just a suggestion! \n",
