        "# Simulation of Laplace's urn puzzle\n",
        "This simulation follows the discussion in chapter 7 of the book *Odds and Ends* by Jonathan Weisberg.\n",
        "Here is a probability puzzle that (appeartly) goes back to the days of Laplace:\n",
        "There are two urns of coloured marbles infront of you:\n",
        "*   Urn X contains 3 black marbles, 1 white.\n",
        "*  Urn Y contains 1 black marble, 3 white.\n",
        "\n",
        "I toss a fair coin to decide from which urn to sample, and then start sampling from the choosen urn with replacement.\n",
        "Two questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Given that procedure, what is the probability that the first sampled marble is black?\n",
        "2.   What is the probability that the first two sampled marbled are black?\n",
        "#### **Answer to 1**:\n",
        "We can use the law of total probability: $P(B) = P(B|U_X)P(U_X) + P(B|U_Y)P(U_Y) $\n",
        "$P(B) =  \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
        "#### **Answering 2**:\n",
        "Since the answer to 1 is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the process we follow seems fair (coin is fair, we draw with replacement), the intuitive answer seems to be $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}$.\n",
        "But the answer is wrong! We can use a simulation to get a sense of the right answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "As usual, we are going to run a simulation according to the rules of the puzzle, count the number of times we get two black balls, and divide that with the number of runs of the simulation\n",
